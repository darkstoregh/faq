### Can I be refunded if my item is damaged or not in its original condition?

Refund amounts may vary. Items that are damaged, missing parts, not in the original condition/packaging, or have obvious signs of use for reasons not due to FastAF error will be refunded up to 50%.

A refund of either store credit or original payment method will be initiated within 24 hours based on the order details, specifically if a promo code/offer was applied and/or if item is part of an exclusive collection.

### Will FastAF be available on Android?

We’re constantly thinking about how we can get FastAF in the hands of more people and we look forward to bring the app to Android soon.

We don’t have any information about additional cities where FastAF will be launching, but we will post any updates to our Instagram page.

### What delivery windows are available?

Our delivery windows are the same every day (with the exception of select holidays). With our new support of nationwide shipping delivery windows will be dynamically based on your zipcode.

### Why are there no available delivery windows?

We have a set number of orders that are available in each delivery window. If none are showing, unfortunately none are available at the moment. The next set of delivery windows will be made available at midnight.

### Why do you charge more for certain products than the brands to on their site or in their stores?

While we partner with the majority of the brands on our platform, some of our brands are not our partner brands yet. Therefore, when you place these orders on our app, you may see prices marked up to offset the cost of delivery and buying.
